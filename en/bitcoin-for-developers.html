<h1>Bitcoin for Developers</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin can be used to build amazing things, or just answer common needs.</p>

<h2>The simpliest of all payment setup</h2>
<p>Until Bitcoin payments needs to be associated with automatic invoices, accepting them is as simple as adding a Bitcoin address on a website as text and QR code picture. This over-simple setup is even at reach of any user and can fulfill the needs of a good range of clients. Especially for donations.</p>

<h2>Many third party APIs</h2><!--Free to build your own system with Bitcoin, with no third party-->
<p>There is many third party payment processing services that provides APIs. So that you don't need to store Bitcoin on your server and handle the security that this implies. At the same time, most of these APIs allows you to exchange your Bitcoins into your local currency at competitive costs.</p>

<h2>You can rule sovereign financial systems</h2><!--Free to build your own system with Bitcoin, with no third party, about no transaction fee-->
<p>If you don't use any third party APIs, you can integrate a Bitcoin server directly in your applications. Allowing you to become your own bank and payment processor. With all responsibilities that this implies, you can build amazing sovereign systems that processes Bitcoin with almost no fee.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin addresses to track invoices</h2><!--Free to build your own system with Bitcoin, with no third party-->
<p>Bitcoin can virtually creates as much Bitcoin addresses as a user wants with no risk of collision. So if you were to build a payment system associated to an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Bitcoin address for each payment. You can also use the same addresses once the payment is done.</p>

<h2>Most of the security is on client side</h2>
<p>Most of all parts of the security is handled by the the protocol on client and Bitcoin network side. Authenticity is verified through private keys and double-spend through the Bitcoin network. That means, no PCI compliance or fraud detection. We love things that just works. Don't we?</p>

<h2>Instant transactions and confirmations</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is usually deployed within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transaction, it is recommanded to enforce a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system.</p>

<h2>Cheap micro payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoin offers the lowest payment processing fees for any type of transaction, including micro-payments. Which means that it can also be used to design and implement new creative online services that could not exist before only because of financial limitations.</p>
