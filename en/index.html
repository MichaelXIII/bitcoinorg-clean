<h1>An open source experimental P2P digital currency</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin is both a currency, a protocol and a free software that enables
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Instant peer to peer transactions</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Worldwide payments</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Little or no processing fees</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">And actually much more..</li>
</ul>
Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out <b>collectively by the network</b>. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment systems.
