title: Choose your wallet - Bitcoin
---
<h1>Bitcoin Client Software</h1>
<p>Bitcoin is a system of merchants, individuals, a network of participants and software. Together they maintain a mutually co-operating infrastructure without the need for authorities - a decentralised peer-to-peer system. A core layer of the Bitcoin system is the Bitcoin network through which people interact with it using Bitcoin client software. Below we list such software.</p>
<p>Bitcoin clients are the base level of technology for conducting Bitcoin transactions. Clients usually store a collection of keys on that computer (often termed a wallet). These keys allow you to send and receive payments through the Bitcoin network. Nobody has access to these keys except yourself, and they must be kept secure. This is where clients differ, with ingenious strategies and ongoing research into making a user-friendly and secure client - not an easy task when both goals often conflict!</p>

<h2><a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin-Qt</a></h2>
<img src="/en/img/clients/bitcoin-qt.png" />
<p>The original software written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the project's founder. If you aren't sure which program to pick, this is a good bet. This application is a peer-to-peer client that builds the backbone of the Bitcoin network. It is suited for enthusiasts, merchants, miners, developers and people who want to help support the project. People who run Bitcoin-Qt are first class network citizens and have the highest levels of security, privacy and stability. However, it can be very resource intensive and you should be willing to leave it running in the background so other computers can connect to yours. If your computer is low powered or you aren't willing to tolerate a 8-hour+ initial start time, you should consider other clients. Cutting edge features tend to be implemented in other clients first.

removable media. Armory is a good choice for experienced
Bitcoin users, seeking additional flexibility and security
for managing their funds.
