<h1>Bitcoin for Individuals</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin is the most simple way to exchange money at very low costs.</p>

<h2>Mobile payments made easy</h2>
<p>Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two steps scan-and-pay. No need to swipe your card, type a PIN or sign anything. And all you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display your QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or send your Bitcoin address by email.</p>

<h2>Fast international payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoins can be transfered from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, eat outrageous fees or even freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country.</p>

<h2>Works everywhere, anytime</h2>
<p>Just like emails, you don't need to force your family to use the same softwares or the same banks. Just let them stick to their favorite service. No problem there, they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!</p>

<h2>Secure transactions</h2>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can make a payment on your behalf or charge you money without having a copy of your wallet. So as long as you take required steps to <a href="/en/you-need-to-know">protect your wallet</a>, Bitcoin provides a nice level of protection against many types of frauds.</p>

<h2>Almost 100% free to use</h2>
<p>You can already send and receive payments for free! Except for special cases like very small payments, there is no enforced fee. You can however choose to pay a small voluntary fee to increase your transaction priority and to remunerate people who operate the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2>Anonymous online payments</h2>
<p>Anonymous payments are a part of our everyday lives as most of real life purchases are done without the requirement to provide a proper identification. Bitcoin now introduces the same freedom to the online world. Allowing you to buy services or make donations without the hassle of being passed under x-ray.</p>
