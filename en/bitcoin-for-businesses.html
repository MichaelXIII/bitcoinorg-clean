<h1>Bitcoin for Businesses</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin is a very secure and inexpensive way to handle payments.</p>

<h2>The lowest fees out there</h2>
<p>Bitcoin's high cryptographic security allows it to process transactions in a very efficient and inexpensive way. As of today, you can make and receive payments using the Bitcoin network with zero fee in most cases. You can pay a very small voluntary fee if you want to increase a transaction's priority.</p>

<h2>Protection against payment/chargeback fraud</h2>
<p>Any business that accepts credit card or PayPal payments knows the problem of payments that are later reversed due to the senders account being hacked, or the sender fraudulently claiming non-delivery. The only way a business owner can defend themselves against these kinds of frauds is complex risk analysis to try and spot repeat offenders, and raising prices to cover for the inevitable losses. Bitcoin payments are irreversible and wallets can be kept highly secure, meaning that the cost of theft is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of merchants.</p>

<h2>Fast international payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. In fact, Bitcoins never have any real physical location. So you can transfer as many of them as you want anywhere with no limits, delays or excessive fees. There are no intermediate banks to make you wait three business days.</p>

<h2>No PCI compliance required</h2>
<p>Accepting credit cards online typically requires extensive security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. While it is a good thing to protect credit cards, Bitcoin security is built in such a way that makes this approach obsolete. Your payments are secured by the network, not at your expense.</p>

<h2>Instant transactions for points-of-sale</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is usually deployed within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transactions, it is recommended to provide a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system.</p>

<h2>Get some free visibility</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching ways to spend their coins. Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment methods has always shown to be a clever practice for online businesses.</p>
