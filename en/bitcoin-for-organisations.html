<h1>Bitcoin for Organisations</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin can provide useful features for donations, creating transparency and working in teams.</p>

<h2>Easiest way to accept donations</h2>
<p>Accepting Bitcoin donations is no more complicated than installing Bitcoin and sharing your Bitcoin address. You can simply put your Bitcoin address as text and as a QR code picture for mobiles on your website. And you're done. People are free to donate to you, with low or no transaction fee!</p>

<h2>Anonymous online donations</h2>
<p>Bitcoin also allows you to receive transactions without requiring to know who is the sender, like real money. And you can still prove that you did not hide any money you received because your Bitcoin address and all transactions related to this address are public.</p>

<h2>Multi-signature</h2>
<p>Bitcoin also includes a feature that is not well known yet that allows coins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people sign the transaction (so-called "n of m" transactions). This is the equivalent of the good old multi-signature cheque system that you might still use with banks today.</p>

<h2>Accounting transparency</h2>
<p>Many organisations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. That means there is a need for good transparency practices. Using Bitcoin offers the highest level of transparency since your balance and every single transaction can be viewed online by any of your members.</p>
