<h1>Bitcoin for Organisations</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin can provide precious features about donations, transparency and team.</p>

<h2>Easiest way to accept donations</h2>
<p>Accepting Bitcoin donations is no more complicate than installing Bitcoin and sharing your Bitcoin address. You can simply put your Bitcoin address as text and as a QR code picture for mobiles on your website. And you're done. People are free to donate to you, with low or no transaction fee!</p>

<h2>Anonymous online donations</h2>
<p>Bitcoin also allows you to receive transactions without requiring to know who is the sender, like real money. And you can still proove that you did not hide any money you received because your Bitcoin address and all transactions related to this address are public.</p>

<h2>Multi-signature</h2>
<p>Bitcoin also includes a feature that is not well known yet that allows some transactions to be confirmed only if x of x persons sign the transaction. This is the equivalence of the good old multi-signature check system that might still prevent you to benefit from modern banking technologies today.</p>

<h2>Accounting transparency</h2>
<p>Many organisations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. That means there is a need for good transparency practises. Using Bitcoin offers the highest level of transparency since your balance and every single transaction can be viewed online by any of your members.</p>
