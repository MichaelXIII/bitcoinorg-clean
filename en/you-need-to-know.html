<h1>Some things you need to know</h1>
<p>If you are about to explore Bitcoin, there are a few things you should know. Bitcoin does not let you send emails or take pictures. It lets you exchange money and value. And as such, it means Bitcoin must receive the same care from you as your wallet.. Or even more in somes cases! </p>

<h2>Securing your wallet</h2>
<p>Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Always remember that you are responsible to adopt good practises in order to protect your money. Here are some options you should consider.</p>

<div class="box">
<h3>Backup your wallet</h3>
<p>Bitcoin services and softwares allows you to backup your wallet or your private keys, which can be printed on paper or save in a USB drive. Stored in a safe place, a backup can protect yourself against computer failure or many human mistakes.</p>
<h3>Encrypt your wallet</h3>
<p>Encrypting your wallet allows you set a password for anyone trying to withdraw any funds. This is a good protection against thief. However, you should make sure you never forget the password otherwise this protection will turns against you.</p>
<h3>Use a online wallet</h3>
Using a online wallet is pretty much like using a online bank. You are trusting someone else to protect your money while you have to remember and protect your password. Your should always choose such services carefully.
<h3>Use a offline wallet</h3>
<p>Using a offline wallet provides the higher level of security for savings. A offline wallet means that you store your wallet or your private keys in a safe place outside of your computer. Which does not prevent you to receive funds on your Bitcoin addresses. And which gives you a good protection against computer vulnerabilities, viruses, keyloggers.. and many human mistakes. It is a good practise to safe the private keys both on paper and in a USB key, on different secured places. As of today, this approach still requires some technical knowledge to be done correctly.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin value is volatile</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is subject to important volatility due to its young economy and its scarcity. Which means it can impredictably gain or lose value over a short period of time. Consequently, keeping your savings in Bitcoin is not recommended. Bitcoin should be considered as a high risk investment and you should never invest money on Bitcoin that you cannot afford to lose. If you receive payments in Bitcoin, many service providers allow you to transfer them instantly in your local currency.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin payments are irreversibles</h2>
<p>Any transaction you issue with Bitcoin cannot be reversed, except by the person receiving the funds. That means you should take care to do business with people or businesses you know and trust. Bitcoin already includes protections to detect many mistakes relative to Bitcoin adresses.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin is as anonymous as you choose it to be</h2>
<p>All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network. Which means anybody can see the balance and the transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, it is not possible to associate a Bitcoin address with its physical owner until the owner publicly proved its ownership. This is why it is recommanded to use many different Bitcoin addresses. Especially for public uses such as websites. You might also want to consider hiding your computer IP address so that it cannot be loggued.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin is still experimental</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Although it becomes less and less experimental every day, that more and more businesses choose to use it and that it has proven to be very secure on many levels. You should still keep in mind that Bitcoin is a new invention that is playing on a ground that has never been explored before. Both from the technical and legal points of view. And as such, its future cannot be predicted by anyone.</p>

<h2>Don't forget to pay your taxes</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is not a official currency nor anything with a clear legal status. That being said, most jurisdictions still requires you to pay incomes, sales, payroll, etc. taxes on anything that has value. Which includes Bitcoin by definition. It is your responsability to inform yourself and to comply with any applicable laws.</p>
