<h1>About Bitcoin</h1>

<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.</p>
<p>In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept is published in a Cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Upon his definitive disappearance in 2010, the creator of Bitcoin never revealed his identity and left his invention like a humble gift to the world. The origin and the motivation behind Bitcoin is still today a great source of mystery.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the Bitcoin community has growth with many benevolent developers working on Bitcoin. During June and July 2011, Bitcoin suddenly gains media attention leading to a massive buy rally. Quickly followed by a major incident inside the most popular Bitcoin exchange MT.GOX, creating an historical panic sell. This event has since been the most concrete demonstration of Bitcoin resilience.</p>
<p>On September 27th 2012, Bitcoin foundation is created in an effort to standardize, protect and promote Bitcoin. And as of today, Bitcoin economy is developping fast with new users every days.</p>
