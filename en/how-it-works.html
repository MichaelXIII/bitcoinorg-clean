<h1>How does Bitcoin work?</h1>

<p>OK, this is a question that often causes confusion. Here's a quick explanation!

<h2>The basics for a new user</h2>
<p>As a new user, you only need to <a href="/en/choose-your-wallet">choose a wallet</a> that you will install on your computer or on your mobile phone. Once your wallet is created, you have your first Bitcoin address and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose one of your Bitcoin addresses to your friends so that they can pay you. The same way, you can pay your friends if they give you their addresses. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works. So all that is left to do that this point is to buy a few Bitcoins and to <a href="/en/you-need-to-know">keep them safe</a>. As a user, you are not required to understand the rest of the technical details.</p>

<h2>Blockchain</h2>
<p>The entire Bitcoin network relies on the blockchain. Which is a <b>shared public transaction log</b>, in chronological order. All confirmed transactions are included in the blockchain with no exception. And there is a reason for this, the blockchain is used to check the balance of a Bitcoin address during a transaction. The integrity of the blockchain is enforced with cryptography.</p>

<h2>Transaction</h2>
<p>A transaction is <b>a transfer of value between Bitcoin addresses</b> that gets included in the blockchain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a <i>private key</i> for each Bitcoin address. Private keys are used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they come from the owner of the addresses. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and confirmed by the network in the following minutes, through a process called <i>mining</i>.</p>

<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>Mining is a <b>distributed consensus system</b> that is used to include and confirm waiting transactions in the blockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the blockchain, protects the neutrality of the network and stops different computers disagreeing on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent any previous block from being modified because it would invalidate all following blocks. And it creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from adding new blocks consecutively in the blockchain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the blockchain or replace parts of the blockchain and roll back their own spends.</p>

<h2>Going down the rabbit hole</h2>
<p>This is only a very short and concise summary of the system. If you want to get into the details, you can <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">read the original paper</a> that describes the systems design, and explore the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Bitcoin wiki</a>.</p>
