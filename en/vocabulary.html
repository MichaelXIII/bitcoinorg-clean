<h1>Some Bitcoin words you might ear</h1>
<p>Bitcoin provides a new approach to payments and as such, there are some new words that might become a part of your vocabulary. Don't worry, even the toaster had to be discovered one day!</p>

<h2><a name="address">Address</a></h2>
<p>A Bitcoin address is <b>the same thing a physical address or a email</b>. It is the only information you need to provide for someone to pay you with Bitcoin.</p>

<h2><a name="blockchain">Blockchain</a></h2>
<p>The blockchain is a <b>public record of all Bitcoin transactions</b>, in chronological order. The blockchain is shared between all Bitcoin users. And it is used to verify the balance of Bitcoin addresses and to prevent <a href="#double-spend">double spending</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="block">Block</a></h2>
<p>A block is a <b>record in the blockchain that contains and confirm many waiting transactions</b>. Every 10 minutes, a new block including transactions is appended to the <a href="#blockchain">blockchain</a> through <a href="#mining">mining</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="btc">BTC</a></h2>
<p>BTC is the unofficial ISO code for Bitcoin. It can be used as an abbreviation, like USD for US dollar.</p>

<h2><a name="confirmation">Confirmation</a></h2>
<p>Confirmation means that a transaction has been <b>verified by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed</b>. One confirmation is pretty secure tough one can wait for a transaction to have 6 confirmations.</p>

<h2><a name="cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<p>Cryptography are <b>mathematical proofs that provide high levels of security</b>. As of today, any online commerce or bank already use cryptography. In the case of Bitcoin, cryptography is used to makes it impossible for anybody to spend funds from other users wallet or to corrupt the <a href="#blockchain">blockchain</a>. It can also be used to encrypt a wallet, so that it cannot be used without a password.</p>

<h2><a name="double-spend">Double Spend</a></h2>
<p>If a malicious user tries to <b>spend all his Bitcoins in two different places at the same time</b>, this is double spending. Bitcoin <a href="#mining">mining</a> and the <a href="#blockchain">blockchain</a> are there to create a consensus on the network about which of the two transactions will be confirmed in the following minutes.</p>
</p>

<h2><a name="hash-rate">Hash Rate</a></h2>
<p>The hash rate is the <b>measuring unit of the processing power of the Bitcoin network</b>. The Bitcoin network must make intensive mathematical operations for security purposes. When the network reaches a hash rate of 10 TH/s, it means it can make ten billion calculation per second.</p>

<h2><a name="mining">Mining</a></h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the process of <b>making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions</b> and increase security. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm and newly created Bitcoins. Mining is a competitive market where the rewards are divided between each competitors.</p>

<h2><a name="p2p">P2P</a></h2>
<p>Peer to peer refers to <b>systems that works like an organized collectivity</b>. Allowing each individual to interact directly with each other. In the case of Bitcoin, the network is built in such a way that each user is broadcasting transactions of other users. And no bank is required as a third party.</p>

<h2><a name="private-key">Private Key</a></h2>
<p>A private key is a <b>secret piece of data that prooves your right to spend Bitcoin from a specific Bitcoin address</b> through a cryptographic <a href="#signature">signature</a>. Each <a href="#address">Bitcoin address</a> have its own unique private key. And your private keys are stored by your Bitcoin software in your computer. Private keys must never be revealed as they allow to spend Bitcoins for their respective Bitcoin addresses.</p>

<h2><a name="signature">Signature</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="#cryptography">cryptographic</a> signature is <b>a mathematical mecanism that allows to proove ownership</b>. In the case of Bitcoin, a <a href="#address">Bitcoin address</a> and its private key are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software sign a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the Bitcoin address. Though, there is no way for the world to guess what is your private key to steal your hard-earned Bitcoins. This is strong irreversible mathematic.</p>

<h2><a name="wallet">Wallet</a></h2>
<p>A Bitcoin wallet refer to <b>the equivalence of a physical wallet on the Bitcoin network</b>. Each Bitcoin wallet can show you the total balance of all <a href="#address">Bitcoin addresses</a> it contains. Just like you can count the money in your real wallet. And in the same way, a Bitcoin wallet allows you to pay a specific amount to a specific person. As opposed to credit cards where you are charged by the merchant.</p>
